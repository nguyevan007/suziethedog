<title> Some Things About Me </title>
<body>
<h2> My Favorite Music Genre</h2>
<p>I prefer mostly all songs that are upbeat and alternative music that sets a calm mood. The upbeat music usually makes me more energetic and happy. The alternative music calms me down and makes me reflect on life. </p>
<h2> My Favorite Animal</h2>
<p> My favorite animal would have to be a panda because they are very cute and cuddly. They also spend most of their time eating which is an interesting lifestyle. </p>
<h3> My Favorite Activities</h3>
<p> I enjoy hanging out with my friends and listening to music. I would like to travel to more places when I grow up locally and far away. </p>
