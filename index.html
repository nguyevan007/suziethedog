<title>The Life of Suzie</title>
<body bgcolor=#FFE4C4>
<h2>General Information</h2>
<p>Suzie is a long-haired Chihuahua with white and light brown fur. She was born on January 16, 2009 in Washington and she is currently 8 years old. <br /> My family had brought her home on March 19, 2009 when she was only 2 months and a few days old. <br /> Suzie lives with a family of 4, with my mom, dad, older sister, and I. <br /> My mom's co-worker had named her <i>Suzie</i> because she thought that the girly name would suit her.<br /> At first, my sister and I wanted to name her "Snowflake" or "Snowball" because of her white fur color, but then she started growing brown fur.<p>

<h2>My Favorite Music Genre</h2>
<p>I prefer mostly all songs that are upbeat and alternative music that sets a calm mood. The upbeat music usually makes me more energetic and happy. The alternative music calms me down and makes me reflect on life.</p>
<h2>My Favorite Animal</h2>
<p>My favorite animal would have to be a panda because they are very cute and cuddly. They also spend most of their time eating which is an interesting lifestyle.</p>
<h2>My Favorite Activities</h2>
<p>I enjoy hanging out with my friends and listening to music. I would like to travel to more places when I grow up locally and far away.</p>
