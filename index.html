<h1>The Life of Suzie</h1>
<p>This is a website dedicated to my dog, Suzie. Here you will find some facts about her and pictures and videos of her. From this website, you will be able to get to know her better.</p>
<h2>General Information</h2>
<p>Suzie is a long-haired Chihuahua with white and light brown fur. She was born on January 16, 2009 in Washington and she is currently 8 years old. <br /> My family had brought her home on March 19, 2009 when she was only 2 months and a few days old. <br /> Suzie lives with a family of 4 with my mom, dad, older sister, and I. <br /> My mom's co-worker had named her <i>Suzie</i> because she thought that the girly name would suit her.<br /> At first, my sister and I wanted to name her "Snowflake" or "Snowball" because of her white fur color, but then she started growing brown fur.<p>

<h2>My Favorite Music Genre</h2>
<p>I prefer mostly all songs that are upbeat and alternative music that sets a calm mood. The upbeat music usually makes me more energetic and happy. The alternative music calms me down and makes me reflect on life.</p>
<h2>My Favorite Animal</h2>
<p>My favorite animal would have to be a panda because they are very cute and cuddly. They also spend most of their time eating which is an interesting lifestyle.</p>
<h2>My Favorite Activities</h2>
<p>I enjoy hanging out with my friends and listening to music. I would like to travel to more places when I grow up locally and far away.</p>
