<p1>The Life of Suzie</p1>
<p>This is a website dedicated to my dog, Suzie. Here you will find some facts about her and you will get to know her better.</p>
<h2>General Information</h2>
<p>Suzie is a long-haired Chihuahua with white and light brown fur. She was born on January 16, 2009 in Washington and she is currently 8 years old. <br /> My family had brought her home on March 19, 2009 when she was only 2 months and a few days old. <br /> Suzie lives with a family of 4, with my mom, dad, older sister, and I. <br /> My mom's co-worker had named her <i>Suzie</i> because she thought that the girly name would suit her.<br /> At first, my sister and I wanted to name her "Snowflake" or "Snowball" because of her white fur color, but then she started growing brown fur.<p>
