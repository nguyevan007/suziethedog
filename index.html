<h1>The Life of Suzie</h1>
<p class="serif">This is a website dedicated to my dog, Suzie. Here you will find some facts about her and pictures and videos of her. From this website, you will be able to get to know her better.</p>
<h2>General Information</h2>
<p id="abc456">Suzie is a long-haired Chihuahua with white and light brown fur. She was born on January 16, 2009 in Washington and she is currently 8 years old. My family <br /> had brought her home on March 19, 2009 when she was only 2 months and a few days old. Suzie lives with a family of 4 with my mom, dad, older sister, and I. My <br /> mom's co-worker had named her <i>Suzie</i> because she thought that the girly name would suit her. At first, my sister and I wanted to name her "Snowflake" or "Snowball" <br /> because of her white fur color, but then she started growing brown fur.<p>

<p id="xyz123">That's all that there is to know about Suzie! I hope that by the end of this, you have gotten a better understanding about who she is. My family and I love her a lot and <br /> we take the best care of her as we can. She loves the family a lot too by always giving us affection and guarding us. Keep in mind that she must get used to strangers before <br /> acting friendly towards them.</p>
